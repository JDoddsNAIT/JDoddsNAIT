### Howdy!! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jonathan Dodds, a second-year Game Programming student at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT). <!-- 2024-2025 --> I use He/Him pronouns, and am an aspiring game developer in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We spell colour the right way. You can reach me through me E-mail at jonathandodds83@gmail.com.

Currently, I'm working on personal projects using the Unity game engine and the Monogame framework. I enjoy systems programming for games, at least for now. I still would qualify myself as a beginner, and am still learning the ins and outs of GitHub and Unity. I mainly use C#, but have experience in Java, and will start learning Godot soon.

Stay awhile, and follow my ongoing journey through game development, I'm happy to have you along for the ride!
