### ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Jonathan Dodds!!
I am a Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) alumni and aspiring game developer. <!-- 2024-2025 --> I use He/Him pronouns, and spell colour the right way.

Currently, I am learning the ropes for the Godot game engine using my Unity skills I learned in school.

So stay awhile, and follow my ongoing journey through game development; I'm happy to have you along for the ride!
